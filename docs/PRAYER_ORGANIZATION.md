# Prayer Organization

Prayers are organized using a flexible **multi-label classification system** that allows prayers to belong to multiple categories simultaneously.

## Understanding the System

### Primary Categories
Each prayer has **one primary theological focus**. For the authoritative list, see:
- **`prayer-schema.json`** - Lines 45-56 define the enum of valid primary categories
- **`lib/prayer-index.json`** - Shows which categories are currently in use

Common primary categories include: `marian`, `christological`, `saints`, `penitential`, `liturgical`, `devotional`, `creeds`, `holy-spirit`, `for-the-dead`, `daily`, `seasonal`

### Labels (Free-Form Tags)
Prayers can have **multiple labels** for flexible classification. Labels are free-form and customizable - create new ones as needed using kebab-case format (e.g., `my-custom-label`).

**Where to find labels:**
- **`lib/prayer-index.json`** - Complete list of all labels currently in use
- **`prayer-schema.json`** - Common examples (but not restricted to these)
- **Existing prayer files** - See how prayers are labeled in `prayers/` directory

The `primary_category` must be included in the `labels` array.

### Importance Levels
Three levels defined in `prayer-schema.json`:
- **`essential`** - Core prayers of fundamental importance
- **`common`** - Standard prayers in regular use
- **`devotional`** - Optional prayers for personal devotion

## Classification Examples

Look at actual prayer files to see how classification works:

- **`prayers/our-father.json`**: 
  - `primary_category: "christological"`
  - `labels: ["core", "essential", "christological", "daily", "rosary", "mass"]`
  - `importance: "essential"`

- **`prayers/hail-mary.json`**: 
  - `primary_category: "marian"`
  - `labels: ["core", "essential", "marian", "rosary", "daily"]`
  - `importance: "essential"`

- **`prayers/prayer-to-st-michael.json`**: 
  - `primary_category: "saints"`
  - `labels: ["saints", "protection", "common", "angels"]`
  - `importance: "common"`

## Language Codes

Eight languages supported (ISO 639-1 codes):

`la` (Latin) • `en` (English) • `es` (Spanish) • `fr` (French) • `de` (German) • `it` (Italian) • `pt` (Portuguese) • `pl` (Polish)
