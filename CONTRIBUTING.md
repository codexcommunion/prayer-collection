# Contributing to Prayer Collection

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Catholic Prayer Collection! This project aims to provide accurate, respectful, and comprehensive traditional Catholic prayers in multiple languages.

## Two Ways to Contribute

### Option 1: Request a Prayer (Easiest)

**[Open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/codexcommunion/prayer-collection/issues/new)** to request a new prayer be added to the collection.

Please include:
- Prayer name
- Source or reference (prayer book, liturgical text, etc.)
- Why it should be included (traditional usage, liturgical significance, etc.)

We'll review the request and add it to the collection if appropriate.

### Option 2: Submit a Pull Request (Advanced)

If you're comfortable with Git and JSON, you can contribute directly:

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Clone** your fork locally
3. **Create a new prayer JSON file** in `prayers/` directory
4. **Run validation**: `npm run validate`
5. **Commit** your changes
6. **Push** to your fork
7. **Open a Pull Request**

**Need help with the JSON structure?** See the [docs/](docs/) directory for details on how to properly structure prayer JSON files, or look at existing files in `prayers/` for examples (e.g., `prayers/our-father.json`).
