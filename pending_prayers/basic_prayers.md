## Basic Catholic Prayers


- [ ] **The Apostles’ Creed**  
I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.  
I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.  
He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.  
He descended to the dead. On the third day He rose again.  
He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father.  
He will come again to judge the living and the dead.  
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints,  
the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.  


- [ ] **Prayer in the Evening** *(Luke 1:46-55 — Magnificat)*  
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,  
my spirit rejoices in God my Savior; for He has looked with favor on His lowly servant.  
From this day all generations will call me blessed:  
the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is His Name.  
He has mercy on those who fear Him in every generation.  
He has shown the strength of His arm; He has scattered the proud in their conceit.  
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones and has lifted up the lowly.  
He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.  
He has come to the help of His servant Israel, for He has remembered His promise of mercy,  
the promise He made to our fathers, to Abraham and his children forever. Amen.  

- [ ] **Prayer at Night** *(includes Canticle of Simeon — Luke 2:29-32)*  
O my God, I thank You for having preserved me today and for having given me so many blessings and graces.  
I renew my dedication to You and ask Your pardon for all my sins.  
Protect us, Lord, as we stay awake; watch over us as we sleep,  
that awake we may keep watch with Christ, and asleep, rest in His peace (alleluia).  
Lord, now let Your servant go in peace according to Your word:  
for my eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples:  
a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to Your people Israel.  
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit.  
As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.  
Protect us, Lord, as we stay awake; watch over us as we sleep,  
that awake we may keep watch with Christ, and asleep, rest in His peace (alleluia).
