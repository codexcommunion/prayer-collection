thine eyes of mercy toward us,

the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary!  
Pray for us, O holy Mother of God,  
that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come;

He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;  
He ascended into heaven, sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty;

because Thou hast revealed them, Who canst neither deceive nor be deceived. Amen.

- [ ] **An Act of Contrition**  
O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee,  
and I detest all my sins because I dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell,  
but most of all because they offend Thee, my God,  
Who art all-good and deserving of all my love.  
I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace,  
to confess my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.  

- [ ] **Prayer to the Holy Spirit**

### Blessed Be God — Devotions for Confession

- [ ] **Before Confession — Prayer to the Holy Ghost**  
Come, Holy Ghost, enlighten my mind, that I may know the sins I ought to confess,  
and grant me true contrition and perfect sorrow for them.  
O Mary, my Mother, obtain for me light to see my faults, and grace to be truly sorry for them.  
My Guardian Angel, help me to make a good confession. Amen.  

- [ ] **Act Before Examination of Conscience**  
O my God, I place myself in Thy presence,  
and I earnestly desire to know my sins, that I may confess them and obtain forgiveness.  
Give me light to see what sins I have committed against Thee, my neighbor, and myself,  
and grant me a true sorrow for them out of Thy infinite goodness. Amen.  

- [ ] **Examination of Conscience (General Guide)**  
Consider seriously before God your sins:  
- Against the commandments of God and the Church;  
- Against the precepts of your state of life;  
- Against charity, justice, purity, and humility;  
- By thought, word, deed, and omission;  
- In the misuse of time, tongue, or temper;  
- In scandal given or good omitted.  
Then ask yourself:  
Have I neglected prayer?  
Have I failed in obedience, temperance, or chastity?  
Have I been proud, selfish, or uncharitable?  
Have I spoken ill of others, injured their reputation, or borne malice?  
Have I taken what was not mine, or been careless in my duties?  
Have I resisted grace or abused the sacraments?  
Have I put off repentance or presumed on God’s mercy?  
Having examined your conscience, make a firm purpose of amendment.  


- [ ] **Act of Sorrow (Alternate)**  
O my Jesus, I am truly sorry for all the sins that I have committed against Thee,  
because Thou art infinitely good and sin displeases Thee.  
I love Thee with all my heart, and firmly purpose, by the help of Thy grace,  
never more to offend Thee. Amen.  

- [ ] **Prayer for a Good Confession**  
O Lord Jesus Christ, who didst breathe on Thy apostles and say to them,

I believe in one God, the Father almighty,  
Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.  
And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God,  
born of the Father before all ages.  
God of God, Light of Light, true God of true God;  
begotten, not made; consubstantial with the Father,  
by whom all things were made.  

Who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven.  
And was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary: and was made man.  
He was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried.  
And the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures.  
And ascended into heaven; He sitteth at the right hand of the Father.  
And He shall come again with glory to judge the living and the dead;  
of His kingdom there shall be no end.  

And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of life,  
who proceedeth from the Father and the Son;  
who together with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified;  
who spake by the prophets.  
And I believe one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic Church.  
I confess one baptism for the remission of sins.  
And I look for the resurrection of the dead,  
and the life of the world to come. Amen.

- [ ] **Last Gospel (John 1:1–14)**  
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  
The same was in the beginning with God.  
All things were made by Him; and without Him was made nothing that was made.  
In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.  
And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.  

There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.  
This man came for a witness, to give testimony of the light, that all men might believe through him.  
He was not the light, but was to give testimony of the light.  

That was the true light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world.  
He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not.  
He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.  

But as many as received Him, He gave them power to be made the sons of God,  
to them that believe in His name; who are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,  
nor of the will of man, but of God.  

And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,  
(and we saw His glory, the glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth. Amen.

- [ ] **Dies Irae (Sequence of the Requiem Mass)**  
Day of wrath and doom impending,  
David’s word with Sibyl’s blending,  
Heaven and earth in ashes ending.  

O what fear man’s bosom rendeth,  
when from heaven the Judge descendeth,  
on whose sentence all dependeth.  

Wondrous sound the trumpet flingeth,  
through earth’s sepulchers it ringeth,  
all before the throne it bringeth.  

Death is struck and nature quaking,  
all creation is awaking,  
to its Judge an answer making.  

Lo, the book exactly worded,  
wherein all hath been recorded;  
thence shall judgment be awarded.  

When the Judge His seat attaineth,  
and each hidden deed arraigneth,  
nothing unavenged remaineth.  

What shall I, frail sinner, pleading,  
who for me be interceding,  
when the just are mercy needing?  

King of Majesty tremendous,  
who dost free salvation send us,  
Fount of pity, then befriend us!  

Think, kind Jesus, my salvation  
caused Thy wondrous incarnation;  
leave me not to reprobation.  

Faint and weary Thou hast sought me,  
on the cross of suffering bought me;  
shall such grace be vainly brought me?  

Righteous Judge, for sin’s pollution,  
grant Thy gift of absolution  
ere the day of retribution.  

Guilty, now I pour my moaning,  
all my shame with anguish owning:  
spare, O God, Thy suppliant groaning.  

Through the sinful woman shriven,  
through the dying thief forgiven,  
Thou to me some hope hast given.  

Worthless are my prayers and sighing,  
yet, good Lord, in grace complying,  
rescue me from fires undying.  

With Thy favored sheep O place me,  
nor among the goats abase me;  
but to Thy right hand upraise me.  

While the wicked are confounded,  
doomed to flames of woe unbounded,  
call me, with Thy saints surrounded.  

Low I kneel, with heart’s submission,  
see, like ashes, my contrition;  
help me in my last condition.  

Ah, that day of tears and mourning,  
from the dust of earth returning,  
man for judgment must prepare him.  
Spare, O God, in mercy spare him.  

Lord, all-pitying, Jesus blest,  
grant them Thine eternal rest. Amen.

Thou art a priest forever according to the order of Melchisedech.  
The Lord at Thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of His wrath.  
He shall judge among nations; He shall fill ruins:  
He shall crush the heads in the land of many.  
He shall drink of the torrent in the way:

His work is praise and magnificence:  
and His justice continueth forever and ever.

The works of His hands are truth and judgment;  
faithful are all His commandments.  
Confirmed forever and ever,  
made in truth and equity.  
He hath sent redemption to His people:  
He hath commanded His covenant forever.  
Holy and terrible is His name:  
the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.  
A good understanding to all that do it:

- [ ] **Psalm 113 (114–115)**  
When Israel went out of Egypt,  
the house of Jacob from a barbarous people,  
Judea was made His sanctuary, Israel His dominion.  
The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.  
The mountains skipped like rams,  
and the hills like the lambs of the flock.  

What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee?  
and thou, O Jordan, that thou wast turned back?  
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams;  
and ye hills, like lambs of the flock?  

At the presence of the Lord the earth was moved,  
at the presence of the God of Jacob,  
who turned the rock into pools of water,  
and the stony hill into fountains of waters.  

Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to Thy name give glory,  
for Thy mercy, and for Thy truth’s sake.  
Lest the Gentiles should say: Where is their God?  
But our God is in heaven; He hath done all things whatsoever He would.  
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;  
as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

O blest Creator of the light,  
who makest day with radiance bright,  
and o’er the forming world didst call  
the light from chaos first of all.  

Whose wisdom joined in meet array  
the morn and eve, and named them day;  
night comes with all its darkling fears—  
regard Thy people’s prayers and tears.  

Lest, sunk in sin, and whelmed with strife,  
they lose the gift of endless life,  
while, thinking but the thoughts of time,  
they weave new chains of woe and crime.  

But grant them grace that they may strain  
the heavenly gate and glory gain;  
and, guided by Thy light, may be  
new chains unbound, new men in Thee.  

To God the Father, and the Son,  
and Holy Spirit, Three in One,  
be endless glory, as before  
the world began, so evermore. Amen.

#### Longer Prayer to St. Michael the Archangel

- [ ] **Extended Prayer**  
O glorious Prince of the heavenly hosts, St. Michael,  
defend us in the battle and in the terrible warfare  
which we carry on against the principalities and powers,  
against the rulers of this world of darkness,  
against the spirits of wickedness in the high places.  

Come to the aid of men whom God created immortal,  
made in His own image and likeness,  
and redeemed at a great price from the tyranny of the devil.  

Fight this day the battle of the Lord,  
together with the holy Angels,  
as already thou hast fought the leader of the proud angels, Lucifer,  
and his apostate host, who were powerless to resist thee,  
nor was there place for them any longer in heaven.  

That cruel, ancient serpent who is called the devil or Satan,  
who seduces the whole world,  
was cast into the abyss with his angels.  

Behold, this primeval enemy and slayer of men  
has taken courage.  
Transformed into an angel of light,  
he wanders about with all the multitude of wicked spirits,  
invading the earth in order to blot out the Name of God and His Christ,  
to seize upon, slay, and cast into eternal perdition  
souls destined for the crown of everlasting life.  

This wicked dragon pours out, as a most impure flood,  
the venom of his malice upon men of depraved mind and corrupt heart,  
the spirit of lying, of impiety, of blasphemy,  
and the pestilent breath of impurity,  
and of every vice and iniquity.  

These most crafty enemies have filled and inebriated with gall and bitterness  
the Church, the spouse of the immaculate Lamb,  
and have laid impious hands on her most sacred possessions.  

In the Holy Place itself, where has been set up  
the See of the most blessed Peter and the Chair of Truth  
for the light of the world,  
they have raised the throne of their abominable impiety,  
with the iniquitous design that when the Pastor has been struck,  
the sheep may be scattered.  

Arise, then, O invincible Prince,  
bring help against the attacks of the lost spirits to the people of God,  
and give them the victory.  
They venerate thee as their protector and patron;  
in thee holy Church glories as her defense  
against the malicious power of hell;  
to thee has God entrusted the souls of men to be established in heavenly beatitude.  

Oh, pray to the God of peace that He may put Satan under our feet,  
so far conquered that he may no longer be able to hold men in captivity  
and harm the Church.  

Offer our prayers in the sight of the Most High,  
so that they may quickly conciliate the mercies of the Lord;  
and vanquishing the dragon, the ancient serpent,  
thou mayest again make him captive in the abyss,  
that he may no longer seduce the nations.  

Amen.
