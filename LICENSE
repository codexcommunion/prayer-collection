## Sacred Content Notice

This collection contains sacred prayers and texts from the Roman Catholic tradition. 
While the software implementation is licensed under MIT, users are encouraged to 
treat the prayer content with appropriate reverence and respect for its sacred nature.

The prayers themselves are traditional texts that have been used in Catholic worship 
for centuries and are considered to be in the public domain. The translations provided 
are based on widely-used liturgical versions and traditional renderings.

For liturgical or official church use, please consult with appropriate ecclesiastical 
authorities to ensure compliance with current liturgical norms and translations 
approved for your region.
